It works on both the client and server, and can be installed on servers without requiring clients to also have the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nWith Phosphor, the amount of time the game takes to generate new chunks can be greatly reduced, and you can expect to see some of the nastier frame stutters caused by loading chunks on the client simply vanish.\n\n<br>\n\nIt's a no-compromises solution for improving performance either in single-player or large multi-player servers, and changes no features or behaviors of the vanilla game.

Since each Chunk\nmeasures `16x16` blocks from a top-down view, you can easily convert between block and chunk coordinates by multiplying / dividing\nby `16`. You can also find the current chunk position with the `F3` debug menu:\n\n<img alt=\"chunkPos\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caeruleusDraconis/world-gen/main/img/chunkPos_real.png\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\nIt is currently not possible to use *WorldGen* directly from the \"Create New World\" screen. Instead, you have\nto first create the world normally, save and quit, and then open the world with *WorldGen*.\n\nFurthermore, we recommend storing your world on an SSD (at least for running *WorldGen*). Using a hard drive can lead\nto scenarios where new chunks are generated faster than previously generated chunks can be saved. This can cause out-of-memory\nerrors, since more and more chunks will accumulate in RAM as time goes on. Additionally, the performance\nof the generator itself may be negatively affected. \n\nAlthough we consider *WorldGen* to be stable, it is recommended to back up your world before using this mod. \nWe are not responsible if you lose your world because you ran into a bug!\n\n## Recommended settings\n\nWhen using *WorldGen*, there is no real upper limit on how many chunks can be generated. \nHowever, we do not recommend using a radius of more than `512` chunks (which would be `8192` blocks in each direction).\n\n## How it works\n\nIn contrast to other existing chunk pre-generation methods our mod does not require a full Minecraft server to be running. \nInstead, a lightweight internal server is used to generate the chunks efficiently.\n\nThis has the advantage of having a **dedicated GUI** and allows **multithreading**. On the downside,\nthe world must be opened in a Minecraft client and cannot be loaded elsewhere while the chunks are being generated with *WorldGen*.\n\n## Supported version\n\nThis table shows the current support status for the Minecraft version.\n\n| Minecraft Version | Status    |\n|-------------------|-----------|\n| `1.20.x`          | Supported |\n| `1.19.x`          | No future updates |\n| `1.18.2`          | No future updates |\n\nNote: For both `1.19.1` and `1.19.2` Use the WorldGen 1.19.x version. However, for Minecraft `1.19.3` and above, the specific WorldGen version for the Minecraft release is required!\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q:** *The progress screen does not fit and is cut off!*\n\n**A:** Try reducing the GUI scale in the Minecraft video options until it fits \n\n---\n\n**Q:** *How do I center the square / rectangle / circle around my current position?*\n\n**A:** Click on the square button on the right of the Center chunk selection row. This will automatically load\n   the last position of the player.\n\n---\n\n**Q:** *Will Minecraft versions before 1.18.2 be supported?*\n\n**A:** No.\n\n---\n\n**Q:** *How do I reset chunks to their original state?*\n\n**A:** First of all: **BACK UP YOUR WORLD!** Afterwards: In the advanced WorldGen settings enable the \"Please allow me to\n   break my world!\" checkbox, then enable \"Override existing chunks\". Also, we recommend using the \"Mode: Coordinates\"\n   in the main menu to reduce the chance of resetting chunks you don't want to!\n\n---\n\n**Q:** *How do I make a perimeter / replace all blocks in chunks with air?*\n\n**A:** First of all again: **BACK UP YOUR WORLD!** Afterwards: In the advanced WorldGen settings enable the \"Please allow me to\n   break my world!\" checkbox. Then, set \"Max. chunk status\" to `structure_starts`. Next, enable \"Override\n   existing chunks\". Finally, set \"Fake chunk status\" to `full`. \n   The generation will stop early and save the chunk as a fully generated one.\n   The \"Max. chunk status\" option allows stopping at different stages of generation, allowing for experimentation.\n\n## Mod incompatibilities\n\nThis mod should be compatible with most mods (including those adding new biomes and dimensions).\nHowever, mods that interfere with the Minecraft world generation process might pose a problem.\n\n### Currently known incompatible mods\n\n| Mod           | Failure                                                  |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Starlight** | Chunks generated with WorldGen will have **no** lighting |\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\nMany thanks to the following projects for supporting open source development:\n\n- GitHub for free code hosting\n- The [Java profiler - JProfiler](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html) for providing a profiling tool\n\n[![JProfiler](https://www.ej-technologies.com/images/product_banners/jprofiler_large.png)](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html)\n\n","published":"2022-06-26T21:01:18.059173Z","updated":"2023-06-08T19:54:16.279246Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1503,"followers":38,"categories":["utility","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["4cMOALBL","IbvwfYSJ","v59z3WWh","IeYiJccF","Lla6ktCg","bUKkzQPx","SJN7EH44","MgudGp0m","Lf19hZv4","FPkvuh91","uWyzbJGy","nHGo0Q9F","QWxJa1jA","wG6NERVp","V6221VtP","TvHHPATd","zRihhidp","VKhVvVah","abNOQw6l","elx9N3ie"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cpNpM0go/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"abNOQw6l","project_id":"cpNpM0go","author_id":"ywiTouYP","featured":false,"name":"WorldGen-fabric-1.20-1.0.3","version_number":"1.0.3","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-08T19:53:27.728221Z","downloads":239,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"8978dd1c9800c6aae40b12a512163f43bdaa6cedc2e3756236d150ebebbe0e537d74d268b84b7a8b54ef2b01d83a9cde2a6adc8b620e269214ba93a8dc7d89cb","sha1":"7b9a16884980270027d8a406a786a34931adb206"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cpNpM0go/versions/abNOQw6l/WorldGen-fabric-1.20-1.0.3.jar","filename":"WorldGen-fabric-1.20-1.0.3.jar","primary":true,"size":149010,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"XheZ9iGK","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"FDnHmtzq","user":{"id":"Lr5PBqZM","username":"Taiterio","name":"Taiterio","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10282898?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-27T15:14:38.252533Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"FDnHmtzq","user":{"id":"ywiTouYP","username":"caeruleusDraconis","name":"Caeruleus Draconis","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108017831?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-22T19:30:37.454558Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"WorldGen-fabric-1.20-1.0.3.jar"},"shaderpacks\\BSL_v8.2.04.zip":{"sha512":"5e7fe400ac8599981b7e2f17690941b7b38df1567778d9618f5f07c199e5732492b356f55cb428061c09e5f048f296b1043b548e2509a5acc7f49accbaae245b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Q1vvjJYV","slug":"bsl-shaders","project_type":"shader","team":"yBO6HNot","title":"BSL Shaders","description":"Shaderpack for Minecraft: Java Edition with high customization and optimization.","body":"![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Q1vvjJYV/images/cf254031c5e71da06946580890ac633f07d90d24.png)\n## ABOUT\nBSL Shaders is a shaderpack for Minecraft: Java Edition with high customization and optimization.

The goal of Complementary v4 is being good at everything. Performance, gameplay, beauty, compatibility; you name it.

with a focus on compatibility.\n\n</div>\n\n## Why Controlify?\n\nControlify is a mod that focuses on mod compatibility, ease of use, configurability and bleeding edge features. \n\nControlify comes with a huge range of settings to fine-tune each of your controllers *individually*, including vibration strength, every single controller input bind (no hardcoding!) and more.\n\nI, the developer, have contributed to popular mods such as Sodium and Iris to get compatibility working in a native-like state, collaborated with do-a-barrel-roll to get elytra flying working seemlessly with controllers (and flight joysticks) and plan to do much more of this in the future.\n\nThe mod is also easy to use for beginners, with default-on button guides, so you know how to interact with the game with a new input scheme.\n\n## Q&A\n\n### Does it support Steam Deck?\n\nYes! Controlify has been tested on the Steam Deck, and works great. The gyro features built-in to Controlify\ndo not currently work on the Steam Deck, but you can utilise Steam Input's gyro -> mouse emulation to get\nworking gyro.\n\n### Does it support *insert generic gamepad here*?\n\nYes! Controlify supports most standard gamepad controllers out of the box.\n\n## Features\n\n### Controller vibration\n\nControlify supports controller vibration, which has not been seen before for PC versions of Minecraft,\nincluding Bedrock Windows 10 Edition. Configure the intensity of each vibration source, with\ncomplex vibration patterns for lots of aspects of the game (e.g. when you take damage).\n\n![picture of vibration config](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/8a7809d07d9e1d9e3002007d7e5e13b73ce8fb5b.png)\n\n### Built-in gyro support\n\nControlify has built-in support for controller gyroscopes, allowing you to make fine movements in-game\nwith your controller. This can be combined with [flick stick](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/bw5xct/flick_stick_is_a_new_way_to_control_3d_games_with/) to be able to use a controller without\nthe compromise.\n\n### Container cursor\n\nJust like in bedrock edition, you can move a cursor across your inventory, and interact\nwith it in a controller-friendly way. With dedicated buttons for quick move, dropping etc. Controlify also comes with cursor snapping, so you don't need to be so precise with cursor movements.\n\n![container cursor screenshot](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/249a2cbaea9b374b33fe67717380e732693dd37a.png)\n\n### Controller identification\n\nControlify has the ability to identify the make and model of your controller automatically,\nand displays relevant button textures for your controller. This is also extendable by resource packs, changing up the button textures in a different style and adding some of your own, more niche controller identifiers.\n\n![demonstration of data-driven identification](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/ec1408d51787b87525b9fb0f2e56b54c5910d384.png)\n\n### Joystick support\n\nYou can connect any joystick to the mod and map it with your own names and textures, with an unlimited amount of inputs per controller.\n\n### Button guide\n\nThere is a simple overlay in-game that displays the buttons you can press\nbased on your player's state and look direction. This is useful for new players, who\nhave not yet memorised the controls.\n\n![image of in-game button guide](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/57c41cee14680c74faf947c5cff355c0af4c35b3.png)\n\nAlso, some GUIs display controller buttons on elements that have a controller shortcut, to easily navigate with a controller like you should be able to.\n\n![image of in-screen button guide](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/511e4182137bb27bbdf95539c8265b9af2038761.webp)\n\n### Containerised Controllers\n\nThis mod is built around the fact that each controller is completely separate, with it's own configuration, bindings etc.\nThis means it will be trivial to add support for split-screen play in the future.\n\n### Built for mod compatibility\n\nGUI operation has been abstracted into a simple API, which allows other mods to easily add support for their own GUIs,\nwithout convoluted support throughout the whole mod's codebase, making it difficult for third parties to integrate.\n\n![demonstration of dabr compat](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/8ee5ec167bc5f8be96da725b10707094559138cb.gif)\n\n*Video recorded using do-a-barrel-roll with a Thrustmaster HOTAS flightstick*\n\n### Automatic controller deadzone calibration\n\nThe deadzone values of your controller are automatically calibrated, \nmeaning you don't have to worry about it.\n\n![image of calibration screen](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/f5f8e2a0a05e61adb95dd919760b424165ca5d14.png)\n\n## What is to come?\n\nA few features in various points in the horizon are:\n\n- Explicit Steam Deck support, with the ability to interface with its gyroscope and be able to handle its extra buttons on the back of the device.\n- A better way to change controller bindings, possibly a custom graphical GUI to pick what buttons do what actions, not the other way around.\n- Split-screen support of some degree.\n\n## Backports?\n\nThis mod is only and will only be available for **1.19.4** and above, this is because in 1.19.4, Mojang\nintroduced arrow key navigation which was easily ported to controller, below 1.19.4, this is not possible.\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](/LICENSE).\n","published":"2023-02-05T13:04:45.141986Z","updated":"2023-08-08T10:19:05.291045Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":80244,"followers":124,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["23w05a","23w06a","1.19.4-pre1","1.19.4","1.20-pre2","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["L5wBKwLP","O4X3TycI","XvbPbLuc","ViaGpYcG","mvoRZ4lr","TSgUsWWO","ZshsEOjG","OVsSpUi5","4eYmOLUb","jvUMhWpD","3L7GCFAd","v9yBe6Ye","hA4E3OIW","pKaQjz0y","60bCNc7N","FLIWpoEL","qHzBhRrd","h5ZThJ8W","FXJNOVCT","GJuiYIvz","uPbwSdJT","aT4dMJAD","xncNJgTg","y7xMOOMU","Oquy1mdB"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/4f8cdb3933f9efa0c5dfd5574d3ad6b101c7f3ef.png"},"version":{"id":"Oquy1mdB","project_id":"DOUdJVEm","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"Controlify 1.5.0+1.20","version_number":"1.5.0+1.20","changelog":"# Controlify 1.5.0 for Minecraft 1.20.1\n\n## New Features\n\n### Radial Menu\n\n![radial menu showcase](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/e56d9be363b2b31440e16018cc01f197848b7ac6.webp)\n\nAdded a radial menu for quick access to up to 8 common binds that could not fit on\nthe controller buttons. The menu can be opened by holding down the bind (right d-pad by default),\nthen selecting with the action you want (right-stick by default) and letting go of the bind.\n\nThe menu can be configured in the config screen, as usual.\n\n### Unknown Controller Submission\n\n![picture of controller submission screen](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/f90fc916c7a40417294db37dc8f72f7729f9b482.png)\n\nWhen your controller is unidentified, a screen will pop up, asking you to send off some\ncontroller data in order for me to add it to the identification database. You can skip this\nscreen if you want to, and it won't bother you again for that controller.\n\n## Changes\n\n### Controller Handling\n\nA lot of changes and improvements have been made regarding the way Controlify handles controllers:\n\n- Moved to an SDL2-based driver when available, you shouldn't notice any difference, but may support\n  more controllers than the old GLFW approach.\n- XInput devices are now named properly in some cases, instead of just \"XInput Controller\"\n- Upon failure of detection, the controller will continue to load, as an unknown controller.\n- Updated the required SDL2 natives version to 2.28.2, hopefully fixing some controller bugs.\n- Reduced the delay before the mouse hides itself after use when using Mixed Input mode (from 3 to 2 seconds).\n- Added the 'PRINT_VID_PID' debug property which prints the vendor and product ID of any connected controller.\n\n### Configuration Screen\n\n- Updated some controller arts.\n- Made the reset button act as an unbind button for controls.\n- Added a new \"What's New\" section to the configuration screen, so it's easier to spot the\n  new features.\n- Fixed controller names not stacking properly when multiple controllers have the same name.\n- Credited Andrew Grant for making the controller art on the carousel screen, with a link to his\n  GitHub.\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\nAs usual, a lot of bug fixes have been made:\n\n- Fixed not being able to type in text boxes after focusing them with a controller.\n- Fixed controller guides in inventory corresponding to the incorrect binds.\n- Fixed rumble not working intermittently.\n- Fix server reach-around not respecting config option and always being disallowed.\n- Fixed the chat rendering incorrectly when hidden.\n- Fixed the controller being disabled when pressing \"Maybe Later\" on the calibration screen\n  if the controller was already calibrated.\n- Fix mixin remap error when starting up the game.\n- Fix missing textures relating to joysticks.\n- Fix missing language entry for joystick axis deadzones.\n\n## Controller Database Updates\n\nChanges to the database that Controlify uses to identify controllers at runtime.\n\n- Added more Xbox controller identifications.\n- Added 8BitDo SN30 Pro & Ultimate.\n\n## Translations\n\n- Update chinese translation\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-08T10:19:11.969197Z","downloads":9,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"6e8fc0f9bd440e48b448fd520ab75fb1cd2796f1","sha512":"83ee4a042c416ed1d03c8a471601b3896e2a53f95788cc1fe1bb19e37b2ba627c83ba3e9a9762740ffe4b895d11d86c645cf01cd0eb3ce0100caebbc37159341"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/versions/Oquy1mdB/Controlify-1.5.0%2B1.20.jar","filename":"Controlify-1.5.0+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":1914338,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"1eAoo2KR","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"ybnbaZLR","user":{"id":"nyx2i4fB","username":"isxander","name":"isXander","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43245524?v=4","bio":"Kotlin & Java Developer","created":"2021-07-23T18:53:58.220173Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Controlify-1.5.0+1.20.jar"},"mods\\journeymap-1.20.1-5.9.12-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"1433b7b93300b04e4456659413f08986693696257f1fccb4b4be78243cf632b2a765804836a788dcaa66308fbe31c35ace14cd2324a7d2147334f6636a95458d","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Journeymap","description":"JourneyMap: Real-time map in-game or in a web browser as you explore.

installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server. This is port `24454` `UDP` by default.\nWithout opening this port, the voice chat will not work.\nThis port can be changed in the server config.\nMore information [here](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/setup).\n\nThe voice chat is encrypted, but we don't guarantee the security of it.

with Fabric.\n\nFabric API is the library for essential hooks and interoperability mechanisms for Fabric mods. Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric. Fabric API is a mod like any other Fabric mod which requires Fabric Loader to be installed.\n\nFor support and discussion for both developers and users, visit [the Fabric Discord server](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv).\n\n## Using Fabric API to play with mods\n\nMake sure you have install fabric loader first.

It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n# 📈 Benchmarks\n\nThe following performance comparisons have been contributed by our community, and they show how Sodium can improve frame rates for a wide range of computers, whether fast or slow.

Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should [make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4409137348877-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Game-Crashes-and-Performance-Issues-FAQ#h_01FFNR5S1APTFHGR9K2W3JANZ4). Out-of-date drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://i.imgur.com/Fud5oyF.png))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison above water](https://i.imgur.com/z9HBcvq.png), [comparison below water](https://i.imgur.com/QQMuOTy.png).) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://i.imgur.com/lYmlmgq.png)) which helps to make everything look smoother.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.

You may have to wait for an update from the authors of those mods.\n\n## Highlights\n\n- **Dramatically improved the performance of terrain rendering in nearly every way.**\n  - Chunk loading is dramatically faster, uses much fewer resources (both CPU and RAM), and should feel much smoother than before.\n    - The amount of time needed to load new chunks (referred to as \"meshing\") has been greatly reduced, and is anywhere from 40% to 60% faster than the previous release.\n    - Memory allocation rate while loading the geometry for new chunks has been decreased by around 80%. \n  - Occlusion culling is anywhere from 25-45% faster now, and the long-standing bugs with it have also been fixed\n    - You've probably experienced those issues where certain parts of the world don't seem to render when looked at from certain angles. Well, those issues are fixed now!\n  - Terrain rendering now uses shared index buffers which can reduce video memory bandwidth/usage requirements by up to 25%.\n- **Fixed major performance regressions NVIDIA graphics cards.**  (anywhere from 200% to 300% faster than previous release...)\n    - If you were previously disappointed by the performance you were getting on a NVIDIA GPU, try this version.\n- \"Render Pass Consolidation\" has been added, which greatly reduces the number of render passes needed for the world (hugely improves CPU and GPU utilization.) This also helps to prevent excessive amounts of overdraw, and ensures larger batches of geometry are sent to the GPU for rendering.\n- \"Block Face Culling\" has been significantly improved, which allows for more blocks to be eligible for early geometry culling (hugely improves GPU utilization.) This generally makes the biggest difference in foliage-heavy scenes.\n- Many other performance enhancements which are too numerous to describe here.\n\n## Other notable changes\n\n- A lot of issues with biome color blending have been fixed. This means it is no longer incorrectly applied to certain blocks, especially those from other mods. Additionally, it's much faster to calculate the colors used by certain blocks, which helps improve world load times.\n- A lot of issues were also fixed with smooth lighting! This should fix some issues with certain resource packs, and the lighting with blocks like Sculk Sensors.\n- Mip-mapping has been greatly improved so that terrain no longer has a black outline around certain textures when viewed at extreme angles. (Note: This has the consequence that some textures, such as those used for leaves, may seem slightly brighter than they did before. However, we think this generally looks more accurate to the original texture work, and believe the original behavior was a bug.) \n- When supported, the mod will now request a \"No Error Context\", which allows the graphics driver to skip some unnecessary CPU overhead during rendering. This slightly helps improve performance on some graphics card drivers.\n- A new driver compatibility and workarounds system has been implemented, which helps to inform the user of possible performance issues & automatically fix them. \n- Line rendering (used by things like Structure Blocks and Hitbox Rendering) is no longer broken.\n- ... Many other improvements for mod compatibility.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-05T00:13:51.574004Z","downloads":58851,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"3c032c494f6d38019b4dcbcd13e6a0fe1f172403","sha512":"506c80ffc90219cff0983b74d9774b892b4a5dd1d60d79cd2972b56dd38bb7d2a2a624be995c9782bae6775b89b4d753227759d6d84e7570986793d245a249de"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/versions/hiO9bwqc/sodium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.5.0.jar","filename":"sodium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.5.0.jar","primary":true,"size":820730,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"VOYxIjFI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"incompatible"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"yM94ont6","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"incompatible"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"4reLOAKe","user":{"id":"TEZXhE2U","username":"jellysquid3","name":"JellySquid","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1363084?v=4","bio":"Professional

Instantaneous: Break one log and the whole tree will fall\n* Shift down: Break a block and the log will slowly shift down as you cut it (good if you don't want to \"cheat\" too much but are lazy to go cut top log blocks 😛)\n* Fall items: Break one log and the whole tree will fall with an animation\n* Fall blocks: Break one log and the whole tree will fall on the floor with an animation\n\n![Demonstration of breaking a tree](https://github.com/Rakambda/FallingTree/raw/minecraft/1.20.1/assets/demo.gif)\n![Another demonstration of breaking a tree](https://github.com/Rakambda/FallingTree/raw/minecraft/1.20.1/assets/demo2.gif)\n\nSeveral options are available in the config file:\n\n* Customize what is considered as a tree (log blocks & leave blocks).\n* Customize what tools can be used (add more axes, allow everything, ...).\n* Turn leaf breaking on/off.\n* Option to disable the effect of the mod by sneaking (can be reversed).\n* Change speed depending on the tree size.\n* Damage tools or not (can set it to break the tool by the amount of blocks there were in the tree).\n* Let tools at 1 durability if it's going to break.\n\nCheck out the [wiki](https://github.com/Rakambda/FallingTree/wiki) for some more information.\n\n---\n\n* For Fabric users, **Fabric API** is required.\n* For Forge users, **Cloth Config

CTOV adds 23 village variants and 14 pillager outpost variants, each of which is tailored to the terrain, theme, and biome of your Minecraft world.\n\nCTOV will not be backported beyond 1.18.2 for the mod version and 1.17 for the datapack version. This means that if you are playing an older version of Minecraft, you will not be able to use CTOV.\n\n<details><summary>FAQs</summary>\n\n1.  **Is it safe to update CTOV to a newer version?**\nYes, it is safe to update CTOV to a newer version. However, if you do experience any problems, please let the mod author know so that they can fix them.\n\n2.  **Is it safe to add CTOV to an already existing world?**\nYes, it is safe to add CTOV to an already existing world. However, the new structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.\n\n3.  **Is this mod for Forge or Fabric/Quilt?**\nCTOV is available for all three mod loaders: Forge, Fabric, and Quilt.\n\n4.  **How can I locate the new structures?**\nTo locate the new structures, you can use the `/locate` command.\n    For 1.18.2, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate ctov:\\[structure\\_from\\_list\\] <br>\n\n    For 1.19+, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate structure ctov:[structure_from_list] <br>\n\n    The `[structure_from_list]` part of the command is the name of the structure that you want to locate. You can find a list of all the available structures in the CTOV documentation.\n\n5.  **Does CTOV modify existing vanilla structures?**\nThe only structures that are modified by CTOV are vanilla villages in older versions. In newer versions, CTOV creates its own structures that are separate from vanilla villages.\n\n6.  **What about the loot of these structures?**\nThe vast majority of structures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility. However, they also use some custom loot tables to integrate said structures into the world better. You will still find pillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as well as bells, workstations, etc., but you may also find new stuff like food, armour, and other goodies.\n\n7.  **How can I report bugs/issues/suggestions?**\nTo report bugs, issues, or suggestions, please go to the CTOV GitHub repo and create an issue. You can also message the mod author on Discord.\n\n8.  **Can I include CTOV in my modpack?**\nYes, you can include CTOV in your modpack. However, please be sure to give credit to the mod author and provide a link to their page.\n\n9.  **Can I have CTOV for 1.x.x, please?**\nIf it's lower than 1.18.2, no. Please don't ask this question. The technical limit is too high here.\n\n10.  **Can I give Choicetheorem any commission or support?**\nThe mod author does not accept commissions or monetary support. They are doing this as a hobby and do not want to be paid for their work.\n\nI hope this answers all of your questions.\n</details>\n\n**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER4.webp)**\n\n\n**ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village (CTOV) is compatible with most world-generation and structure mods.** It also works with Guard Villager and other structure packs by ChoiceTheorem. Mods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs.\n\nHere are some more details about the compatibility of CTOV with other mods:\n\n-   **World-generation mods:** CTOV relies on vanilla biome Tags, so almost all world-generation mods like Terralith, Oh Biome You'll Go, and Biomes O'plenty will have appropriate CTOV villages in their biomes.\n-   **Structure mods:** Various structure mods like Town&Tower and Repurposed structures also work well with CTOV. However, it is important to exercise caution when using too many mods, as this can cause instability. The same applies to Better Village.\n-   **Other mods:** Any other mod that doesn't affect villages and villagers will be compatible by default. Mods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs, which can be found on the Modrinth website.\n\n<details><summary>Mod integration</summary>\n\n\n-   [✓] [**Waystone (Before version 3.2.1)**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-waystone-compat) \n-   [✓] [**Farmer's delight**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-farmers-delight-compat)\n-   [✓] [**More villagers**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-more-villagers-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Croptopia**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-croptopia-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Bountiful (Before version 3.2.1)**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-bountiful-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Friend and Foe**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-friends-and-foes-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Immersive Engineering**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-immersive-engineering-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Incubation**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-incubation-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Chef's delight**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-chefs-delight-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Beautify**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-beautify-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Vampirism**](https://modrinth.com/mod/vampirism-integrations)\n-   [✓] [**Domestication Innovation**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-domesticated-innovation-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Wizards**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-wizards-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Villager Plus**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-villagers-plus-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Advance peripheral**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-advanced-peripheral-compat)\n-   [✓] [**BYG**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-byg-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Savage and Ravage**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-savage-and-ravage-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Vending Machine**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-vending-machine-compat)\n-   [✓] [**All bark All bite**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-abab-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Gazebos**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-gazebo-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Paladins & Priests**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-paladins-n-priests-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Paragliders**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-paragliders-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Pneumatic craft**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-pneumaticcraft-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Jelly Fishing**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-jellyfishing-compat)\n-   [✓] [**Iron's Spells 'n Spellbooks**](https://modrinth.com/datapack/ctov-irons-spells-n-spellbooks-compat)\n-   [ ] Questager -

how worlds are loaded to speed up loading times.","body":"# NOTICE!!!!!!\nI (StockiesLad) have quit modding again. This will explain the absence of updates. Why again? It's just not fun anymore and I am always worried about once again being embedded in annoying discord drama that somehow manages to suck every bit of enjoyment out of modding. There hasn't been anyone willing to step up and take over development and that's partly my fault. This notice is months late. If you enjoy fastload and intend to maintain it, just contact me on discord for a discussion. Please keep in mind that I won't respond quickly because I don't really use discord much at all anymore. Thank you for taking your time to read this!\n\n# Short explanation\nFastload is a *relatively* simple mod that changes some crucial parts of world loading to speed it up.\n\n# Environments\n- Client (Optional)\n- Server (Optional)\n\n# Credits\n- StockiesLad (Owner)\n- JoostMSoftware (Co-Owner)\n- AbdElAziz333 (Forge)\n- VidTu (Ksyxis (Idea))\n- kennytv (Forcecloseloadingscreen (Code))\n\n# Features\n- 441 Pre-generator: Entirely yanks it to sync chunk generation with chunk rendering.\n- Loading Screens: Cancellable (Configurable)\n- Rendering: Pre-rendering Phase (Configurable)\n\n# Suggested With\n- C2ME: Optimises chunk generation.\n- Sodium: Optimises chunk rendering.\n\n# Explanation\nThe 441 chunk loading engine is pretty much what the name is. The reason for it being 441 chunks is that\nit generates chunks in a 10 chunk radius as a square. So multiply that by 2, add 1 (because you are standing\non a chunk) and square it. Fastload removes this *feature* as it is a huge waste of time. Instead, it will\nonly load 1 chunk (the spawn chunk) and loads the rest of the spawn region during early rendering.\n\nAlong with that, it also replaces some of the loading screens with its own implementation. This pretty much\nallows rendering to begin immediately instead of it being halted until the player spawn packet is received.\n\n# Links\n- Modrinth: https://modrinth.com/mod/fastload\n- Curseforge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastload\n- Discord: https://discord.gg/fMSnenNSXM\n\n","published":"2022-06-04T16:09:02.891982Z","updated":"2023-06-17T11:58:02.789670Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":420110,"followers":867,"categories":["optimization","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b","23w14a","23w16a","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["OAv8CrM0","hR5aj90D","Lbph3YVy","nkXCDjTX","CVP8s8T3","tFMofdbs","3j5R1tqr","opd0zx0e","iiKA1DWl","DVbkQeRT","bAEd4DsW","PjaIK1Vp","tAJHf9G7","wIStpaL0","8J8D4v6o","1wIMDix7","BnPn5A62","f4sYhmcE","meWCSzii","DJkYeZd5","1f1DA0KB","QNff3l3l","QlIwIIh9","C2LwOzJk","1uyZI4Sv","FKmzXNtY","K88McHch","DQlQxhhM","qIDVvUbg","nAfxWveV","MmygcB2M","zNe7bwry","Tv3wOvtj","ksl46t40","qkR1zzal","dKaZj3NX","bxgfNPxE","LtO049ip","RWontocM","tMBTPH4j","rGmamzE5","gdXi90uO","Dsgo7CSj","2Yda0wxa","pPHZxvSq","mBNst1pT","NHYFVTEV","WyunD6Js","N1SrNeBH","IpZXHH55","rxKwFSer","ZlGXwJvh","TQqs51tn","DadZpSjE","tMPV3Kkg","ZF0uERgW","FpDn2R2L","gIRDVsr1","a5IjqNvz","DlCLRU3a","WU1it2AO","FU50wLzH","DhZ4Ja4S","Y0vyVBp6","suyTpHDo","gO58JOqR","K9vr5fdy","OQyAqgWH","AWGFfzNY","Jy0nBwT7","n2GBDiY8","YvKzIdFE","lbg7lLOP","XzqjhWvy","GCH0zDV1","cOIVKLwU","FswsA1ru","pDTCLzgm","s3zsS0HW","tykaPrWr","ILYiaB6n","jbjSMJqM","JpRTQ4PR","vD6ndABa","WryJ0FUZ","FcFh2FAO","PB8AbQO3","BwDnLgzN","OxwM6hRt","u4FVRRGd","ys9T20o4","47qpvpOP","P17HkM27","9Kgnmrza","3cboK7gk","HDvAnQIw"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/kCpssoSb/47742fe96d19cdad9a3eb6a73bd9c7c1547fb4ad.png"},"version":{"id":"ys9T20o4","project_id":"kCpssoSb","author_id":"6RqzXTwc","featured":false,"name":"Fastload+1.18.2-1.20-3.4.0","version_number":"3.4.0","changelog":"Fixed a couple bugs, improved internal api, updated some dependencies, updated embedded fabric api to support the latest snapshot","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-05-03T07:15:33.055038Z","downloads":111305,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"b57e4d594031638b0dc076a3b6e501f417700577","sha512":"024e9aa775037fe8727ac8aca55f68d2f6782dd87d099446f967ebbeb6eab73f0f0580eca100cb565f70bab02abce03239af0fca17248ceef2c05caa1cfcdd1e"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/kCpssoSb/versions/ys9T20o4/Fastload%2B1.18.2-1.20-3.4.0.jar","filename":"Fastload+1.18.2-1.20-3.4.0.jar","primary":true,"size":567412,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"3AXCrCqA","username":"AbdElAziz","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89092953?v=4","bio":"I love all people","created":"2022-05-27T22:49:23.800376Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Contributor","ordering":0},{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"6RqzXTwc","username":"StockiesLad","name":"Fluffy Bumblebee","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60066663?v=4","bio":"A lad from stockies mate.","created":"2022-06-04T16:04:13.709905Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"GIn4UWLW","username":"JoostMSoftware","name":"Joost","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80041873?v=4","bio":"I'm a student Software Engineer that codes websites and mods for games.

Tweaks","description":"Enhances inventory management by adding various functions to the mouse buttons. ","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2023-06-11T22:37:13.588249Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":145948,"followers":760,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"m0Dd8Cjy","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.20+ Fabric] Mouse Tweaks 2.25","version_number":"1.20-2.25-fabric","changelog":"- Updated to Minecraft 1.20.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-11T22:37:15.141667Z","downloads":24399,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"04f017920be9e982c945df0d27ef93a4cace730b7bc6fd46a82c028c50f7d6819ec0a4c28a4454bc681b4591eeddb08b74c330cb577d7a697a2391fcc11d925d","sha1":"21ae6dd81324543e77c10bbb2b928320d71b6750"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/m0Dd8Cjy/MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.25.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.25.jar","primary":true,"size":77342,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"3bb877f7683b45ff74c5e507aa3c3d263ca3b898eaef58f39c7681cff26cc8a34fbdabb65e9ad46b72c001b2cc8293dc7e02f9f6e26399e008ba4f85833ebebb","sha1":"a54dee75a5447fe29ab0d1b9f2f6a64c9531337f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/m0Dd8Cjy/MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.25-sources.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.25-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":65191,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"XheZ9iGK","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":"eTCL1uh8","project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gn6mAc1d","user":{"id":"On32SQVu","username":"YaLTeR","name":"Ivan Molodetskikh","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794388?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-03-20T15:35:29.504966Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.25.jar"},"mods\\Tips-Fabric-1.20.1-12.0.1.jar":{"sha512":"c36805575568081386cad5d8bd9a254271b7f9d46e7c1de18b9e6e55dd3217402c59985ad30354b0c1b58c8384bc978519a653f2cffcad31923b22ed20c944b0","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"AMCbgyVw","slug":"tips","project_type":"mod","team":"SEOvZNdW","title":"Tips","description":"This mod adds tips to loading menus.

Paxi adds the <b><em>paxi</em></b> folder in your Minecraft config folder, where you can place data and resource packs that will automatically be loaded for every world. The first time you run Paxi, the <b><em>paxi&nbsp;</em></b>folder will be created for you in your Minecraft config directory.</p>\n\n<p>Paxi is as simple as it gets when it comes to global data and resource packs, making it a great utility for modpack creators!</p>\n\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9VzCAAC.png\" alt=\"Data packs\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nWithin the <em>paxi</em> folder is a <b><em>datapacks</em></b> folder for data packs. This folder will be created for you the first time you create or load a world with Paxi installed. Any data packs placed in this folder will be automatically loaded into any world you play - in other words, globally loaded data packs! When in game, use the command <code>/datapack list</code> to see all loaded data packs; packs loaded by Paxi are printed in pink text. Both zip files and regular folders (containing a pack.mcmeta file) are supported.</p>\n\n<p>\nData packs can also be loaded in a specific order! The first time you create or load a world with Paxi installed, the <em><b>datapack_load_order.json</b></em> file will be created for you in the <em>paxi</em> directory. You can fill this JSON file with a list of data pack folder names (including the .zip for zip files) in the order you want your data packs loaded in. Using this JSON file is entirely optional - any data packs not listed in the file will be loaded normally (alphabetically by folder/zip file name, same as normal data packs). So if you only have a few data packs that require loading in a specific order, you only need to list them in the JSON!</p>\n\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cSWd9iG.png\" alt=\"Resource Packs\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nAlso within the <em>paxi</em> folder is a <em><b>resourcepacks</b></em> folder for resource packs. This folder will be created for you the first time you run the game with Paxi installed. Any resource packs placed in this folder will be automatically loaded when you start the game. Both zip files and regular folders (containing a pack.mcmeta file) are supported. Resource packs are not supported on dedicated servers, since they only affect the game on the client-side (textures, sounds, and other assets).</p>\n\n<p>\nResource packs can also be loaded in a specific order! The first time you create or load a world with Paxi installed, the <em><b>resourcepack_load_order.json</b></em> file will be created for you in the <em>paxi</em> directory. You can fill this JSON file with a list of resource pack folder names (including the .zip for zip files) in the order you want your resource packs loaded in. Using this JSON file is entirely optional - any resource packs not listed in the file will be loaded normally (alphabetically by folder/zip file name, same as normal resource packs).

zoom mod with infinite customizability.*\n\nZoomify aims to provide the easiest, most configurable and most sexy looking zoom mod you will ever find.\n\n![Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/zoom-example.gif)\n\n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n\n</center></div>\n\n## How to use\n### Keybind\nInitially, Minecraft has a keybind that overrides Zoomify by default.\nGo to the controls menu and make sure the Zoomify keybind (default `C`)\nisn't conflicting (goes red).\n\n### Open settings menu\nYou can access the settings menu with two ways.\n\n- The client command `/zoomify`\n- [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) settings button\n\n## Features\n### Scroll Zoom\nYou can zoom in further using your scroll wheel.\n\n![Scroll Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/scroll-zoom-example.gif)\n\n### Spyglass Integration\nYou can configure Zoomify to only be able to zoom in when you are holding or carrying a spyglass.\nOr even just override the spyglass zoom with Zoomify!\n\nShow the spyglass overlay and play spyglass sound effects when using Zoomify.\n\n![Spyglass Integration Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/spyglass-integration-example.gif)\n\n### Transitions\n**14 different** transitions to choose from!\n\n- Instant\n- Linear\n- [Ease in Sine](https://easings.net/#easeInSine)\n- [Ease out Sine](https://easings.net/#easeOutSine)\n- [Ease in/out Sine](https://easings.net/#easeInOutSine)\n- [Ease in Quad](https://easings.net/#easeInQuad)\n- [Ease out Quad](https://easings.net/#easeOutQuad)\n- [Ease in/out Quad](https://easings.net/#easeInOutQuad)\n- [Ease in Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInCubic)\n- [Ease out Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeOutCubic)\n- [Ease in/out Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInOutCubic)\n- [Ease in Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeInExp)\n- [Ease out Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeOutExp)\n- [Ease in/out Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeInOutExp)\n\nYou can even pick what transition you would like for zooming in and out individually!\n\n![Individual Transition Config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/individual-transition.png)\n\n### Relative Sensitivity\nReduce your mouse sensitivity based on the amount of zoom,\nso you have fine control over your player.\n\n![Relative Sensitivity Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-sensitivity-example.gif)\n\n### Relative View Bobbing\nReduce the view bobbing effect based on the amount of zoom,\nso you can walk and zoom at the same time!\n\n![Relative View Bobbing Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-view-bobbing-example.gif)\n\n### Cinematic Camera\nMake the mouse/camera smooth, like the zoom in [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net).\n\n![Cinematic Cam Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/cinematic-cam-example.gif)\n\n### Affect Hand FOV\nTurn off this setting to prevent your hand from also being zoomed in!\n\n![Affect Hand FOV Turned Off Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/affect-hand-fov-disabled-example.gif)\n\n### Secondary Zoom\n\nCompletely separate zoom from normal Zoomify.\nAimed for content creators, features `Hide HUD While Zooming` option and longer zoom in times.\n\n![Secondary Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/secondary-zoom.gif)\n\n### Presets\n\nYou can reset to default, make Zoomify behave like OptiFine and others!\n\n### Smart Keybinding Detection\n\nOn first launch, if a keybinding is conflicting with Zoomify's zoom, a notification will appear notifying them of this.\n\n![Keybinding Conflict

Compared to vanilla, Better Fortresses are much larger, more complex, and more rewarding. Each fortress is comprised of three parts — the bridge networks, the Keep, and the Lava Halls that extend deep underground.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses also includes built-in Create compatibility!</b> If you're using Create, certain parts of the fortress have a chance of spawning using Create pieces. Note that this is an optional feature — Create is not required to run this mod. Be sure to use the latest release of Create for your Minecraft version! Note that this is for 1.19.2+ only.\n</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/omRqM-gZBAg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

game logic/server optimization mod","body":"Lithium is a modern, general-purpose optimization mod for Minecraft which works to improve a number of systems (game physics, mob AI, block ticking, etc) with the goal of **not changing any vanilla mechanics**. \n\n<br>\n\nThe mod works **on both the client and server**, and can be installed on servers **without requiring clients to also have the mod** (and vice versa.)\n\n<br>\n\nFor multiplayer servers, administrators can expect a sizeable improvement to tick times, allowing their hardware to support more loaded entities, chunks, and players. Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n","published":"2021-01-03T00:56:52.292581Z","updated":"2023-06-12T23:58:54.348243Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1780502,"followers":5483,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["EhG1mQzx","5fmGl08Y","ouTdXXWj","igqdFUYG","pGhOMdTm","Le0tKjFX","rvsW1zhb","7jxErppe","aZ0JFf08","cTZv31gu","nVR7Q63z","FHFKMKeu","2w527DB2","2CbyxeU0","2aoHIXuK","Ehsd7YUl","MoF1cn6g","pHl1Vi6k","pXdccFQf","sIKhU9s4","ZRR9yqHD","Zs3sdHjK","Nba2vozh","2ysRxhIL","ySBrfN8N","xVm1caOt","IQxlSIiw","FXG2XqRP","ALnv7Npy","OKrb9xMn","3Gq9H7R9","7scJ9RTg","XS6vJwop","sMWkk4VU","GYl3zwgt","m6sVgAi6","53cwYYb1","14hWYkog","2KMrj5c1","ZSNsJrPI"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ZSNsJrPI","project_id":"gvQqBUqZ","author_id":"uhPSqlnd","featured":false,"name":"Lithium

There are also new terrain types: canyons, shattered biomes, floating islands, deep ocean trenches, and much, much more.\n\n**Yellowstone** is one of Terralith's staple biomes - a simple and beautiful landscape, based on the real life US National Park. Among the list of realistic biomes are **Yosemite Cliffs**, **Shield**, and many more depending on what you're looking for in a biome. **Highlands** and its variants offer a flat surface to create on - builders can imagine anything from huge mega cities to small simple cottages. Adventurers can explore the breath-taking **Volcanic Peaks** and discover the beautiful **Desert Oases**.\n\nWhile realistic biomes can remind us of the beautiful planet we live on, Terralith offers a plunge into the world of fantasy as well. Adventurers can wander through the purple and mystical **Moonlight Grove** and **Amethyst Rainforest**, or climb the unforgiving cliffs of the **Scarlet Mountains**. If determined, sailers can find the mysterious **Mirage Isles**, or even the elusive and nostalgic **Alpha Islands**. Terralith encourages imagination to run wild here.\n\nIf you feel the surface is too face, have no fear - custom caves lurk beneath your feet! Similar to Minecraft's Lush Cave, the **Underground Jungle** is full of foliage, and rarely some old abandoned houses. Other caves, like **Infested** and **Fungal Caves** are overgrown with spiders and fungi! If you dig super deep, you could stumble upon a sister to the Deep Dark: the **Frostfire Caves** are dangerous and menacing. Beware!\n\n### Structures\nTo tie all of Terralith's magnificent biomes together are it's structures. The ominous tall **Spire** pierces the sky in the iciest biomes. Rarely, you can find **Fortified Villages** in the plains and desert - the villagers have progressed quite far as a society! Finally, if you find yourself lost at night, cold and hungry, you might stumble into the warm protection of the simple Glacial Hut.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ","published":"2022-11-13T21:48:54.507121Z","updated":"2023-07-31T04:41:03.834705Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":76823,"followers":586,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["Q9qUUqA7","Wd3Co0mZ","81tshMIZ","Xf5mFGCS","jUK1mCz3","1latp88m","pNFzTzQd","mLdNNka6","K3S6BASh","aYOzrVFZ","Y4i2gvLB","D0hKeWDQ","JT2esX5R","8N8lLvTW","34PhE3zd","2w1uZoRC","PNByHzei"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/34c751cc804839ed3c1d9f21dfd53d98368fedfc.png"},"version":{"id":"34PhE3zd","project_id":"8oi3bsk5","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":true,"name":"v2.4.3 ~ 1.20.1","version_number":"2.4.3","changelog":"# Terralith 2.4.3\n\n- Prevented odd (but rare) occurrence of Underground Jungle not being underground\n- Removed an old file, which drastically reduces the file size","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-21T19:06:10.739704Z","downloads":5368,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"bc8ff17ab79b95a1744110d7ad59cedfe1cae2b90653d2c163901985a0332f6318d4863eae1beda5bfc761956cf68ce8f019491c4cbad7eb3360cf6547f1c0cc","sha1":"f87aaa2d3f288fdd2ad7f1f7736ba0b35037a5f5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/versions/34PhE3zd/Terralith_1.20.1_v2.4.3.jar","filename":"Terralith_1.20.1_v2.4.3.jar","primary":true,"size":2739836,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"L2q5L80c","user":{"id":"SR8MIsEo","username":"catter1","name":"catter1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63272345?v=4","bio":"Technical Lead for Stardust Labs.

No more!</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">At a time where there's a lot of mods and even more items, you'll need functional and capable backpack. Since the traveler's backpack can provide about <strong>45 inventory slots</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>2 fluid tanks</strong>, which each can store up to 4 buckets of fluid or even 16 bottles of potion&nbsp;(Now even more, since it's configurable!), this backpack becomes a really good option to consider. All inventory slots and tanks can be accessed via external pipes. The backpack also provides special buttons - <strong>sort</strong>, <strong>quick stack</strong> and <strong>transfer</strong> to seamlessly manage inventory!</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Chestplate or backpack? Why not both? (Now with Curios integration! 1.16+)</span></span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Traveler's backpack doesn't need any empty armor slot (or other slot, unless Curios integration is enabled) to be worn. Player can wear one backpack on his back at the time and it's inventory can be accessed via <strong>B</strong> (Configurable) button.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>The best gear for adventures!</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here comes the Traveler's Backpack! You are able to use crafting inside of backpack's inventory or pull out the sleeping bag in any time you want! Don't worry, you won't lose your spawn point! Also worth taking advantage of handy tool slots (Tool swapping described below), which render directly on backpack. Fluid tanks in combination with Hose Item (Hose functioning described below) are good portable fluid storage.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/UkVUU6N.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1903\" height=\"723\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Customization that you have never seen!</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Choose your personal style from over 45 custom backpacks, which represent various creatures and blocks. As if that weren't enough, some of them can provide special abilities! All backpacks' textures have been remade one by one to fit new Minecraft style. 1.16+ versions provide <strong>dyed backpack</strong>. You can combine whichever dyes you want!&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6nzBlK2.png\" width=\"1123\" height=\"1009\" /></p>\n<hr />\n<h1><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Inventory guide</span></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Traveler's backpack inventory can be split into segments, which have different functions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Here you can see the inventory:</span></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/inwSgPA.gif\" width=\"900\" height=\"963\" /></p>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong>Blue slots&nbsp;</strong></span>stand for base backpack inventory, where you can store your items.</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Green slots&nbsp;</strong></span>accept only tools and provide special inventory action - Tool cycle (See below)</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong>Brown slots</strong>&nbsp;</span>are mostly crafting grid and one of them is crafting result slot.

Tank is selected if its border is white, this also means that hose is active. Hose attachment resets everytime when you take off your backpack or remove hose from inventory, so make sure that any of the tanks is selected. There are 3 hose modes, which I'll describe below:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Suck Mode</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can pick up the fluid from the world or - <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">if clicked on suitable tank</span> - transfer fluid from clicked tank to your backpack's tank.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Spill Mode</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">You can spill the fluid into the world or - <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">if clicked on suitable tank</span> - transfer fluid from your backpack's tank to clicked tank.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Drink Mode</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Allows player to drink some tank's contents - <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">not all fluids are drinkable</span>, some of them may give special effects though.</p>\n<p><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Additional Tips</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Swap tank attached to hose</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you wear a backpack and hold hose, click <strong>N</strong> to swap tank which hose is attached to.

Many mods utilize Bookshelf's code base to power their own mods.</p>\n\n<h3>Why use a library mod?</h3>\n<p>Library mods such as Bookshelf allow seemingly unrelated mods to share parts of the same code base. This reduces the amount of time and effort required to develop certain mods and features. The Library's code base is also tested in a wider range of circumstances and communities which can lead to less bugs and better performance in mods.</p>\n\n<h3>Features for Players</h3>\n<p>While this mod is primarily for mod authors, there are a few useful features for Players.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug commands</a> like /bookshelf hand to get item IDs.</li>\n<li>Many new <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs\" rel=\"nofollow\">datapack features</a> like crafting recipes that damage items with durability rather than consuming them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Features for Modders</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/blob/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/serialization/Serializers.java\" rel=\"nofollow\">Serialization for JSON/Network/NBT formats.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/tree/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/util\" rel=\"nofollow\">Utility Functions.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/tree/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/registry\" rel=\"nofollow\">Registry manager, including non-forge registry types, debugging, and statistics.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug commands.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#recipe-types\" rel=\"nofollow\">New recipe types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#ingredients\" rel=\"nofollow\">New ingredient types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#loot-conditions\" rel=\"nofollow\">New loot condition types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#global-loot-modifiers\" rel=\"nofollow\">New loot modifier types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#item-predicates\" rel=\"nofollow\">New item predicates.</a></li>\n<li>Check <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wiki</a> for more!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

YUNG's Better Desert Temples redesigns vanilla desert temples to be way more exciting, adding a variety of new puzzles, traps, &amp; parkour challenges. And of course, you'll get much better loot than vanilla's desert temples for your troubles!\n</p>\n<p>\nBy default, mining fatigue will be applied to all players in the Better Desert Temple. Once you clear the temple (i.e. kill the pharaoh at the end of the temple), the mining fatigue effect for that temple will be permanently lifted! You can disable this feature in the config. Additionally, you can re-enable vanilla desert temples to spawn alongside Better Desert Temples in the config.\n</p>\n<p>\nCloser look: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TpkTeTeDKJo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnimated trailer: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1C5Z0DaOQk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JR6R3uf.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better Desert Temples is intended to be fully compatible with every worldgen mod, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Mineshafts\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-mineshafts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Mineshafts</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Strongholds\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-strongholds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Strongholds</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Dungeons\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Dungeons</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Extras\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Extras</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Bridges\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-bridges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Bridges</a></li>\n<li>Repurposed Structures.

This is __not__ required, but it allows all items to have their own beautiful textures.\n- Incendium is **not** compatible with Amplified Nether\n- Do not add this to an existing nether - reset yours first, or use a new world\n- View the structures and biomes per seed using [jacobsjo](https://github.com/jacobsjo)'s [Minecraft Datapack Map](https://map.jacobsjo.eu/)\n\n## Description\n### Biomes\nIncendium adds 8 unique biomes to the nether. Do you bravely venture through the perilous **Quartz Flats**, wander the mysterious **Withered Forest**, or battle your way through the steep **Infernal Dunes**? Each biome has a unique personality and story to tell. With unique block themes in each biomes, opportunities for new farms for technical players, 3D biomes, and stunning terrain, there is truly something for everyone.\n\n### Structures\nTo compliment the lovely biomes, there are 9+ structures for you to explore and conquer. In the Ash Barrens, the **Foribdden Castle** stands forbodingly, with courageous Piglins defending its treasured loot - one of the largest and complex random structures in Minecraft! Alternatively, you can conquer the ominous **Sanctum** with its illagers defending dark secrets and strong weapons. The skeleton chef Torte defends his **Quartz Kitchen**, and the Withered Director his **Nether Reactor**. What will you conquer first?\n\n### Items\nEvery mob you defeat and structure you conquer has its reward - Incendium pays you handsomely with both rick loot and custom weapons! Defeating the Hovering Inferno could earn you the **Trailblazer** - a flame-spewing bow. A high damage, but taxing **Greatsword of Sacrifice** hides within the Forbidden Castle's walls, along with the helpful **Hefty Pickaxe**. Or maybe you prefer to find the **Hazmat Suit** to protect you from all types of poisonous attacks. There are over 25 items to forge your own playstyle with!\n\n### Mobs\nNo datapack would be complete without its own mobs to fight you. The Toxic Heap is home of the agile **Toxic Slimes**, and the Withered Forest is haunted by the **Restless Spirits**. On the other hand, you could go on a rescue missue to save the **Ghastling** from the Abandoned Tower - in return, it will defend you from Ghasts. If none of this is challenging, you can summon the all-powerful **Hovering Inferno** boss for a difficult and dirty battle.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ","published":"2022-11-23T00:20:14.180965Z","updated":"2023-07-20T21:28:32.951503Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":18367,"followers":217,"categories":["adventure","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["xnhu8xeb","NoanBvKE","S6fQNiYx","lS3rnfXC","nNDmHrHX","ednvmJkC","wdO4nfDE","QzTAZ3vy","4bK01rdc","g34x6icZ"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZVzW5oNS/65c8dcaaf260e5b2182c228a1a442c792a7c4782.jpeg"},"version":{"id":"g34x6icZ","project_id":"ZVzW5oNS","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":true,"name":"v5.3.1 ~ 1.20.1","version_number":"5.3.1","changelog":"Bug Fixes and Tweaks.\n\n- Warping Witherblade drop rate increased to 33%\n- Sanctum Mobs will no longer despawn\n- Blazing Hatchet correctly able to be used on Bamboo, Cherry, and Mangrove logs\n- Blazing Hatchet now able to be used on all stripped variants of logs\n- \"To-do List\" note in Abandoned Tower uses the correct translation system\n- Torte's Cake Batter added to Admin Menu\n- Vault Guardians are now more resistant to fireworks","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-20T21:28:34.933108Z","downloads":1948,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"fd7c9b4fb73f11af300589dd2625010c5abd514002753a3cb4fcd9874dcdc872d9ead6e35d41b68595220f6bebd8d463d0b2b96c962df2899c2c423c59184307","sha1":"1590eca06e935f7003587c8c67401589d4bcc34b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZVzW5oNS/versions/g34x6icZ/Incendium_1.20.1_v5.3.1.jar","filename":"Incendium_1.20.1_v5.3.1.jar","primary":true,"size":4362594,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"LySsSrT8","user":{"id":"SR8MIsEo","username":"catter1","name":"catter1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63272345?v=4","bio":"Technical Lead for Stardust Labs.

mod was made to fill a hole in this area of Fabric modding. The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**:<br/>**It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**:<br/>**It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**:<br/>**It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**:<br/>**It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Client sided library.** YACL is built for client mods only, making it a smaller size.\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div align=\"center\">\n\n![java_A3zdbksGkC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206924832-293b0780-2a8c-4b09-8765-155318d09ed9.png)\n\n</div></center>\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](LICENSE).\n","published":"2022-09-02T11:05:20.777780Z","updated":"2023-07-24T15:18:47.806903Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"optional","downloads":472890,"followers":1058,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w42a","1.19.3","23w05a","23w06a","1.19.4-pre1","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WRaSIAfC","9TFyuVJN","DM1biniZ","iYzpWd2Z","Af0BJTus","6Fl6Ilzn","RsiSJn8g","4M515h9Z","Op8HYd0I","knEInTQd","2To1GHMW","zngBEiw5","JLCAxM5G","FKVJYGyf","hbt0DzsC","FxNs8Edj","EyhlJvkj","VdIvtIwz","mW3CVg5N","UIAaWmvd","wibQ6TRj","GkKQsCJ6","3EWbdCzX","bIVYcRpm","eQtAB8nC","TWgoDEtx","TXnYvmpI","RmZvIqeu","A04AftxZ","RLTQViRg","51iCmuDG","sj4aPwnQ","NZpUvhBc","nMuzsoQt","M5iKxVFU","VHMFG82e","6EBKvxyG","qHhZ3Mlp","CSXeGyWW","zRlTTWFK","yShEHkWR","kr3UvTk4","jZFsc9tg","oIlFdLZI","8WHpxnmg","SiEAKMh4","gfyPkvYv","Vc0cNGqC","uRw9Zalc","HOxWjhyo","9ACWUOXp","wa9YGZhd","ZqWkEgYo","zoMzOEbl","LM15Ky9N","vASIPGay","zJ1Wh6pM","DjwHtlVp","omClzsLe","zU7Ejh24","g38uL3ti","3vGF9MOJ","SqpDFYpa","M1u6F79I","3HHSMwA9","IsGTmmrV","CgwTUAR2","RPlKFmas"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1eAoo2KR/1e43d5714f87ac6b20622e73b3ba7209be5ebafb.png"},"version":{"id":"CgwTUAR2","project_id":"1eAoo2KR","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"3.1.0+1.20 (Fabric)","version_number":"3.1.0+1.20-fabric","changelog":"# YetAnotherConfigLib 3.1.0 for 1.20\n\n## API Changes\n\n### `ListOption` changes\n\nA PR by [Crendgrim](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/89) - thanks a lot!\n\n- Allow to specify size limits for option lists.\n  - This allows to set a minimum and maximum length for the option list with the `minimumNumberOfEntries`\n    and `maximumNumberOfEntries` builder methods.\n- Allow \"reversed\" lists that add new options at their end.\n  - List options until now always grew at the top.
